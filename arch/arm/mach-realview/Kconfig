	help
	  Enable support for the ARM11MPCore RevB tile on the Realview
	  platform. Since there are device address differences, a
	  kernel built with this option enabled is not compatible with
	  other revisions of the ARM11MPCore tile.

	  RealView boards like PB11MPCore have 512MB of RAM available
	  contiguously at 0x70000000. Half of the memory is mirrored
	  at 0x00000000 for backwards compatibility. Use this option
	  to change the physical base address so that the full amount
	  of RAM is available to Linux.
